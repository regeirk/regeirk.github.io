<p>Data scientist at Bloomberg LP | Machine learning, computer vision,
artificial intelligence, automation, data management, mentoring, public
speaking | Ph.D. in physical oceanography</p>
<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>I solve complex problems using data, algorithms, and a combination of
technical expertise, problem-solving skills and intuition. Whether I’m
improving existing systems or breaking new ground, I approach every
challenge with curiosity and precision.</p>
<p>From a young age, I was captivated by building with Lego bricks,
designing intricate Märklin model railroads, and programming on a
vintage ZX Sinclair Spectrum clone. These early passions laid the
foundation for my career in data science and research, where I’ve spent
over 20 years combining scientific rigor with creative
problem-solving.</p>
<p>As a seasoned researcher and data expert, I specialize in leveraging
data and advanced computational techniques to optimize data workflows
and empower evidence-based decision-making. My expertise spans machine
learning, artificial neural networks, data analysis, ocean hydrodynamic
numerical modelling, satellite remote sensing, and software
development.</p>
<p>I’m passionate about leading data-driven projects, collaborating with
diverse teams, and mentoring others to help them reach their full
potential. My approach combines deep technical expertise with clear,
effective communication, ensuring that complex insights are translated
into actionable solutions for both technical and non-technical
stakeholders.</p>
