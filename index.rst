I am a data scientist at `Bloomberg <https://www.bloomberg.com>`_. I am responsible for implementing and curating end-to-end financial data flows for Latin America, including the setup and monitoring of ETL pipelines, and pre- and post-publish quality control. I also develop and implement machine learning models to expand our data coverage (e.g. financial conditions index, agricultural crop yield forecast) and to detect anomalies in our data sets. In addition, I mentor colleagues in applying computer programming best practices and assist journalists with data-driven news.

I am an analytical, dedicated and detail-oriented problem-solver with a strong and diverse academic background in data analysis, physics and geophysical fluid dynamics.

I am comfortable with a variety of technologies and a lifelong learner and have experience with international collaboration.

I hold a Sc.D./Ph.D. in oceanography from the `Oceanographic Institute <https://www.io.usp.br>`_ of the `University of São Paulo <https://www.usp.br>`_, and I have received a master's degree in physical oceanography from the University of São Paulo, and a bachelor's degree in physics from the `Physics Institute <http://portal.if.usp.br/>`_ of the University of São Paulo.

B. MORE PROFESSIONAL INFORMATION
================================

#. Author of the `pycwt <https://pypi.org/project/pycwt/>`_ Python package for continuous wavelet spectral analysis. The `Github repository <https://github.com/regeirk/pycwt>`_ has 174 stars and 80 forks (as of February 22, 2022).
#. Lead developer for the Brazilian financial conditions index published on the Bloomberg Terminal as `BZFCIBBC Index <bbg://screens/BZFCIBBC%20Index%20DES>`_. 
#. I gave a presentation about `recipes for geodata management in oceanography <https://www.slideshare.net/regeirknaitsabes/recipes-for-geodata-management-in-oceanography>`_, during a workshop hosted by the NF-POGO Alumni Network for Oceans. I have shared other presentations on my `slideshare <https://www.slideshare.net/regeirknaitsabes/>`_ page, however most of them are in Portuguese.
#. I also usually attend `PyData Meetups <https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/PyData-Sao-Paulo/>`_. `This is the recording <https://youtu.be/rHOGZ3Y8Bik?t=367>`_ of one of the presentations I gave (in Portuguese) on how to extract financial data from unstructured documents using crowd workers and integrate them into a data automation workflow.
#. Here are copies of my `doctoral dissertation <https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/21/21135/tde-09022015-091716/publico/Tese_Sebastian_Krieger_Original.pdf>`_ and `master thesis <https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/21/21132/tde-30062009-151822/publico/dissertacao.pdf>`_, both in Portuguese.
#. I was the editor and co-author of some articles for the `8th newsletter <http://nf-pogo-alumni.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/NN8_May15.compressed.pdf>`_ of the NF–POGO Alumni Network for the Oceans, May 2015.

C. UNIQUE VALUE ADDED / DIFFERENTIATOR
======================================

* My interest in physics and oceanography taught me how to think about processes and to break large complex systems into smaller and usually simpler connected pieces.
* I am a self-taught computer programmer and `Python <https://python.org>`_ is currently my preferred programming language because of its general purpose, elegant and simple syntax.
* I use principles of Scrum to incrementally deliver solutions.
* I prefer to tackle new challenges by first putting some effort in better understanding the problems and the underlying processes.
* I like to mentor and teach colleagues in technical matters, while continuously broadening my knowledge and experience in different, sometimes complimentary, areas.
